Some notes on creating a child theme:

1. This directory contains a very minimal example of a Weaver II Pro Child theme.

2. You can use functions.php to write functions to override any function in the main theme that is wrapped by
   an "if (!function_exists('func_name'))" check. Most of these are in functions.php, but a few are found
   elsewhere in the code.

3. You can provide a complete replacement for template-type files in the parent. These are files that generate
   output HTML directly such as 404.php, archive.php, or footer.php. You can tell these mostly because they
   generate lots of HTML that will make up the final output page, and that many of them are used
   by the "get_template_part" function.

4. The sample code has an example of overriding a template part - 404.php. There are comments in the file to explain.

5. This sample code will work with the Weaver II Basic theme. You must edit the style.css an make two changes
   (two instances of 'weaver-ii' to 'weaver-ii-pro') to use this example with the Pro version

6. Weaver II has been designed to accommodate child themes. If there are additional sections that need function_exists
   wrapping, or should be template files, suggestions are welcome.
