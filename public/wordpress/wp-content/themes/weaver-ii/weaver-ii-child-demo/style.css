/* Use the following @import for parent Weaver II theme.
  IMPORTANT:
  For free weaver, the @import line should use: url('../weaver-ii/style.min.css')
  For Weaver II Pro, you MUST make two changes.
	For the @import, use: url('../weaver-ii-pro/style.min.css')
    AND
	Change the above line "Template: weaver-ii" to be "Template: weaver-ii-pro"

*/
@import url('../weaver-ii/style.css');	/* alternatively, you can use style.css instead of style.min.css */

/* Minified version: You can create a minified version of this file for your child theme
  directory called style.min.css. If you do that, you MUST have both the child style.css and
  the child style.min.css. The style.min.css version will be used automatically if it is defined.

  ------------------------------------------------------
 Add specific style overrides here...

  Just for example, this style will increase the base font size of the site.
